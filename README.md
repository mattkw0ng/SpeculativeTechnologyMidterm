# Speculative Technology
#### by Matt Kwong



## Overview
A web based simulation/game that allows the user to explore and decide on the different stages of integration of this technology into society. Each 'page' is a separate state that has buttons that nagivate the user to another state. These are created and managed using complexStateManager class, which reads the interactionTable.csv file to get all of the data. Similarly, the buttons are all generated based on the clickableLayout.csv file.

## Technical Details
### Inlcuded:
- sketch.js : handles all of the drawing with p5.js
- assets : folder containing all .png images and fonts
- data : folder containing all .csv files

- p5.clickable.js : button handling class (also modified)
